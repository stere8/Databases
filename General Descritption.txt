I. Introduction

For the purpose of learning and/or practicing :
 *Django in Python
 *and Entity Framework in C#
 *PHP
I am going to build three apps that are going to do the same functions with these three different techonologies.


II.Overall Description:
The way these 3 apps will work is that all wil be a student database.

1.For starters it will be a page to add students to a database.(Adding to the created database)
2.Then we will try to display the addeed students.(Viewing the components of the created database)
3.And finally we will edit and delete the students.(Edit the database)

II.1

The primary components of the students information wil be 

1. The ID
2. The Name
3. Surname
4. Age
5. Year
6. Graduation Year

II.2

As you have noticed there are some basic information lacking on the first description like Course or Grade.
This is because the Courses are fixed courses and Grades too there are not optional. There exists know ways of grading
and the school has a known list of courses.
So insteade of inputing them manualy which might create problems(such as is a student studies "international economics" and by mistakes
they write "International Economy", there would be case problems and the -ies/-y problem.) That is why we will create a second table of
known courses and another of known grades. Which will be done in a more advanced way after creating the first ones in an easy and 
comprehensible way.

More info will be found in the respective files containing each techonology.
