OK,
This is my off-the-script django project-been doing tutorials only lately. So try to be a little understanding :)
The general description was already given so let's dive right into it.
To start we will need to define a few things

1.The Student(Model):
He will be one class(for the beginning), With a few attributes which are :

1. The ID : int and pk
2. The Name : charfield with max of 60
3. Surname : charfield with max of 60
4. Age : int
5. Year : int
6. Graduation Year : int

See, easy peasy lemon squeezy :)

2.Pages(View):
To start, we will have the index taking us to a student adding page, 
which will allow us to add those attributes.

3.URLS:
we will use a second url which will take us to adding students
